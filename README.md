For some exercices you might be required to use a header file in your project.
If this is the case please follow the instructions below.

```sh
# In order to activate the "MyHeaderEC.h"
# click in Visual Studio on your 'C' source file

# -> Go to properties
# -> All Options
# -> Search for "Include" 
# -> Click on "Additional Include Directories"
# -> Click on the dropdown (reversed arrow)
# -> Edit
# -> Click on "new line" (*[]) icon
# -> Click on '...'
# -> Search for the directory where you put the header file and click on add

# NOTE : 
# When you include "MyHeaderEC.h" you will have to put the "MyFunctions.c" into the same <project> as your "<source>.c" file
# such that once you compile that project the compiler knows the location of each file on your system
```
